#
# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM: the output is platform-independent JavaScript, and
# bun >= 1.4 aborts under QEMU, so cross-building the linux/amd64 leg on an arm64

# --ignore-scripts skips better-sqlite3's node-gyp native build: the image runs
# under Bun and the mirror uses bun:sqlite, so the compiled binding is never used,
# and the TypeScript build only needs the package's type declarations.
