/**
 * @fileoverview Sanctions ingesters — one per source (OFAC SDN, OFAC
 * Consolidated, EU FSF, UK Sanctions List, UN SC Consolidated, India UAPA,
 * UAE Local Terrorist List). Each streams its source file, lifts out one record
 * at a time, and maps it onto the common {@link NormalizedDesignation} schema.
 * The {@link createSanctionsSync} factory wires them into the MirrorService
 * `sync` generator: each refresh re-harvests every source in full (the combined
 * corpus is tens of thousands of rows — no delta logic needed), yielding bounded
 * pages as records arrive.
 *
 * **Why streaming.** `SDN_ADVANCED.XML` is ~120 MiB of the ~172 MiB sanctions
 * corpus. Buffering a document and DOM-parsing it held the XML string, the
 * parsed tree, the normalized array, and the row array at once, peaking past
 * 2 GiB and OOM-killing `mirror:init` before GLEIF started (#13). Each source is
 * now scanned for complete record fragments (`xml-stream`) and each fragment
 * parsed on its own, so peak memory tracks the largest single record and one
 * page, not the document.
 *
 * **The OFAC deferred join.** OFAC advanced is not a flat repeating document:
 * `<ReferenceValueSets>` opens it, but `<SanctionsEntries>` — which supplies
 * `program` and `designationDate` — is published *after* every
 * `<DistinctParty>`. A single forward pass cannot attach those fields inline.
 * Both columns are nullable, so parties stream out as they are read and the
 * programme fields are collected behind them into {@link DeferredDesignationFields},
 * applied by the sync as an UPDATE once the source's rows have landed.
 *
 * The XML shapes differ wildly across sources; each parser is defensive about
 * sparsity and arrays-of-one (fast-xml-parser collapses single children to
 * objects), and preserves absence rather than fabricating fields. A record whose
 * source published no stable entry id, or no usable name, is dropped and counted
 * — see `ingest-validation` for why an identifier is never minted.
